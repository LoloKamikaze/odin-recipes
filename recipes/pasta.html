    <p><h2>What is pasta? Italian pasta (pronounced “PAS-tah”) is a collective name for a category of food made from wheat flour and water, sometimes with egg</h2></p>
    <p><h3> Pasta is traditionally made from wheat, water, eggs, and salt. The first pasta dish was made in Sicily and dates back to 1154. Historians have noted that this first recipe was closer to a lasagna than to what we know today as our traditional noodles because it had a meat stuffing.</h3></p>
